# ProjectSniper

This is a project where we are trying to make a simulation game for sniper shooting. We do this in our free time, because we wanted to do a
project together. It's just going to be target practice. So there's going to be a target a few kilometers away, and you just have to hit it
in the centre. Simple as that. Except for:

We are trying to put as much real factors in as possible. So the bullets fly with a real trajectory and just in a straight line.
We're also going to make it hard, by not giving the distance to the target. So that's why you're going to look at the surroundings, so you
have to calculate the distance yourself. Easier for us, so we don't have to do it for you.

So yeah. It's going to take a while, because we won't be working on it all the time, and we just started. But we do have fun creating it
step-by-step.

We hope you will enjoy it someday!
